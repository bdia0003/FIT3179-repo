</div>

<div id="timebrush_map"></div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1">
    <p>The term "skyscraper" was first applied to buildings of steel-framed construction of at least 10 storeys in the late 19th century, a result of public amazement at the tall buildings being built in major American cities like Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, Detroit, and St. Louis. 
      Skyscrapers represented mankind's limitless ambition and provided a substantial profitable solution towards the shift to an increasingly urban lifestyle.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
    <p>Over time, skyscrapers became staples of major urban cities all around the world. The United States of America is currently home to over 600 skyscrapers and a multitude of skylines within its cities. Skyscrapers within the US have been consistently trying to outperform previous record holders and reach new heights. For the entirety of the 20th century the US has always been home to the world’s tallest skyscraper. The Empire State Building held the title of world’s tallest skyscraper for 40 years, followed by the Willis tower which held it for 28 years.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column3">
    <p>The construction of skyscrapers also presented opportunities for economic growth throughout time. Skyscrapers have always attracted people towards urban areas using its numerous floors for purposes such as office spaces and residential living areas, as well as providing tourist attractions such as skydecks and city views. The construction itself also creates job opportunities for thousands of people. We can see that a significant number of skyscrapers which are currently the tallest buildings in their respective city were built during the Global Financial Crisis. </p>

    <div class="column1">
      <p>When it comes to cities with the greatest number of tallest buildings, New York City and Chicago take lead. This is no surprise as these are some of the largest metropolitan areas in the world. A lot of the buildings in New York City and Chicago serve a variety of purposes, while the tallest skyscrapers found in other cities such as the Space Needle in Seattle are often built as tourist attractions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column2">
      <p>As seen with the Top 30 skyscrapers, the typical number of floors is between 60 to 70. This is because having additional floors can also increase costs over time. As skyscrapers get taller, the costs of maintenance increases and so do the degree of risks in case of emergencies. If skyscrapers do not have occupants in majority of its available floors, there is a high chance of incurring large expenses. For instance, the Great Depression took a large toll on the occupation of the Empire State Building resulting in only one quarter of the building being used and a net profit occurring in the 1950s.</p>
